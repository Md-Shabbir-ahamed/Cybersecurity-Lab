## Local-Cybersecurity-Lab: Offense & Defence Simulation.  

This projrct's main goal is to created and model a broad cybersecurity lab setting so that we can practice and obtain practical experince in a range of cybersecurity related topics. 

## Objective: 

This project set up a multi-VM environment including a firewall, an attacker machine, a vulnerable target, a security monitoring platform, and internal workstations. This setup allows for realistic simulations of cyberattacks, defensive measures, and incident analysis.

## Key areas of focus

 * Network setup and management.
 * Vulnerability management.
 * Security Monitoring.
 * Penetration testing.
 * Threat monitoring.

## Tools

 * VirtualBox network setup.
 * Virtual Matchin (VM) installation and configuration.


## Install Virtual Machines (VMs) 

pfSense network configuration. 
Network Configuration:
 *Adapter 1: Attached to NAT (for internet access).
 *Adapter 2: Attached to Host-Only Adapter. 
 *Set the LAN IP address to 192.168.56.1.

## Kali Linux (Attacker) 

 * Primary attacking machine.
 * Install Kali Linux from the ISO.
 * Ensure it obtains an IP address from pfSense's DHCP.
 * Familiarize yourself with pre-installed tools: OpenVAS, Metasploit, Wireshark, Nmap.

## Metasploitable2 (Vulnerable Target) 

An intentionally vulnerable Linux VM for practicing exploits.
 **Network Configuration:**
    * **Adapter 1:** Attached to `Host-Only Adapter`.
 4.  Install Metasploitable2 (it's often a pre-built VMDK, so you might import it 
 or create a new VM and attach the existing virtual disk).
 5.  Default credentials are `msfadmin`/`msfadmin`.

## Security Onion (SIEM/Monitor)

 **Network Configuration:**
    * **Adapter 1:** Attached to `Host-Only Adapter`.
 4.  Install Security Onion from the ISO. Choose **"Evaluation Mode"** for a quick 
 setup.
 5.  During installation, configure the monitoring components like **Elastic, 
 Suricata, Zeek, and Wazuh**.

 
## Simulate Business Infrastructure

Once all VMs are installed and connected to the Host-Only network, verify the lab setup.

| Subnet | IP Range | Devices |
| :----- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LAN** | `192.168.56.1/24` | pfSense LAN (gateway), Metasploitable, Kali, Ubuntu, Security Onion (all get IPs from pfSense's DHCP) |

 **Ping Test Connectivity:** From Kali, try pinging Metasploitable, Ubuntu, and Security Onion's IP addresses to confirm they can communicate.
 **Firewall Rules:** Log into pfSense's web interface (`192.168.56.1`) and experiment with creating firewall rules to block specific traffic (e.g., block SSH from Kali to Ubuntu) or enable specific services.

## Vulnerability Scan (OpenVAS)

 **Run from Kali:** Launch OpenVAS (or Greenbone Vulnerability Management - GVM) from your Kali VM.
 **Scan Targets:** Configure scans against Metasploitable2 and Ubuntu Server.
 **Analyze & Export:** Review the scan reports to identify vulnerabilities. Export the report (PDF) for documentation.

## Penetration Testing 

The Metasploitable2 virtual machine is the main target of this section's active exploit of found vulnerabilities in the lab environment.
 
**Tools & Activities:**

* **Metasploit Framework (from Kali Linux):**
  
    * Explore and utilize various **exploit modules** against services running on 
    Metasploitable2 (e.g., `vsftpd` backdoor, Apache Tomcat manager).
    * Attempting **lateral movement** to other internal VMs (if applicable, 
    after initial compromise).
    * Document successful exploitation paths and the impact of the vulnerabilities.
* **Other Kali Linux Tools:** Utilize other Kali tools for reconnaissance, scanning, and initial access as needed before launching exploits.

## Threat Monitoring

This section focuses on actively observing, collecting, and analyzing security events and network traffic within the lab to identify malicious activity. The primary tool for this is **Security Onion**.

   **Tools & Activities:**

  * **Security Onion (SIEM/IDS/NIDS/HIDS):**

    * **Packet Capture:** Observe and capture network traffic generated by 
    activities on other VMs (e.g., Nmap scans from Kali, Metasploit exploitation 
    attempts against Metasploitable2).
   * **Alert Analysis:**
        * Utilize **Suricata** (Network Intrusion Detection System) to detect 
        signatures of known threats and generate alerts.
        * Access the **Security Onion web interface (e.g., Kibana, TheHive, Analyst Workbench)** to review alerts, pivot through logs, and investigate suspicious activities. Look for evidence of:
            * Port scanning activity.
            * Exploitation attempts and successful shell access.
            * Unusual network connections.
