## Local-Cybersecurity-Lab: Offense & Defence Simulation.  

This projrct's main goal is to created and model a broad cybersecurity lab setting so that we can practice and obtain practical experince in a range of cybersecurity related topics. 

## Objective: 

This project set up a multi-VM environment including a firewall, an attacker machine, a vulnerable target, a security monitoring platform, and internal workstations. This setup allows for realistic simulations of cyberattacks, defensive measures, and incident analysis.

## Key areas of focus

 * Network setup and management.
 * Vulnerability management.
 * Security Monitoring.
 * Penetration testing.
 * Threat monitoring.
